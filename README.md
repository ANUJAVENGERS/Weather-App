# Weather-App
A weather app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides users with real-time weather information for their location and other locations worldwide. It utilizes an API key for data fetching, allowing it to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather data. The HTML structure includes elements for displaying weather details, while CSS styles the app for a visually appealing user interface. JavaScript handles the logic for fetching weather data from the API, updating the display dynamically, and providing an intuitive user experience.
